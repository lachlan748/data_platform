The goal of this project is to simulate a production network using code.

## Objectives

*  Deploy immutable virtual network infrastucture on Cisco Modelling Labs 2.1
   via API calls.

*  Store the network IPAM data in Netbox

*  Generate and deploy configuration files using Ansible Roles + Netbox

*  Connect immutable virtual servers to the network and simulate production
   network traffic including unicast and multicast data flows.

*  Monitor traffic flow and telemetry data, visualize using Kibana/Grafana
